This Kaggle challenge involved a classification problem (with 7 different classes) based on a dataset of forest parcels. The data consisted of 55 columns, including 11 numerical variables and 2 categorical variables (with 4 and 40 classes, respectively). To tackle this problem, we employed strategies detailed chronologically in this report. After an initial data exploration phase and attempts at dimensionality reduction, we tested several classic algorithms and proceeded with optimizations where possible.
