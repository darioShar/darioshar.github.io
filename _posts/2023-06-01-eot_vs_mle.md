This paper explores the entropic optimal transport (EOT) loss and its estimator in parameter estimation, comparing its advantages over traditional likelihood methods, such as improved robustness, faster convergence, and resilience to bad local optima, with a focus on theoretical justification and experimental validation in Gaussian Mixture Models.
