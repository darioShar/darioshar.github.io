I am a 2nd year PhD student at INRIA Paris (Sierra Project-team) working under the supervision of [Umut Simsekli](https://www.di.ens.fr/umut.simsekli/) and [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr). 

Before that, I obtained an MSc in Mathematics from the University of Oxford, and a BSc/MSc from Ecole Polytechnique. More information about professional and academic experiences can be found in my [CV](/files/dario_resume.pdf).
